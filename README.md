The `enflow/laravel-excel-to-google-sheet` package provides an easy way to push Laravel Excel exporters to Google Sheet. 
Use-cases include creating a Laravel Export to be exported in your application layer, which also needs to be periodically synced to a remote Google Sheet.

## Installation
You can install the package via composer:

``` bash
composer require enflow/laravel-excel-to-google-sheet
```

## Authentication
The package uses the [Google Client PHP library](https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-php-client) in the background. Authenticating with Google requires a Google Cloud Console account. 
Via the Google Cloud Console account, you must have a valid project, where the `Google Spreadsheet API` is enabled. To export the required JSON credentials, you can follow the steps below:
1) Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2) Create a new project or select an existing project
3) Go to `APIs & Services` > `Credentials`
4) Click `Create Credentials` > `Service account`
5) Choose `Spreadsheet API` for the scope.
6) Fill in the required fields and click `Create`
7) Select the created service account and click `Add key` > `Create new key`
8) Select `JSON` and click `Create`
9) The JSON file will be downloaded to your computer
10) Copy the contents of the JSON file and place it in a secure place. We recommend `storage/secrets/google-service-account.json`

## Implementation

To start, publish the config file:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Enflow\LaravelExcelToGoogleSheet\LaravelExcelToGoogleSheetServiceProvider" --tag="config"
```

After, you can add your existing Laravel Excel export classes to the `exports` array:
```php
'exports' => [
    'teams' => \App\Exports\TeamsExport::class,
],
```

After setting up the exports, we recommend running `php artisan push-export-to-google-sheets` to validate the exports are pushed correctly.

To periodically schedule a push from your Laravel Excel export to a Google Sheet, you can schedule the `Enflow\LaravelExcelToGoogleSheet\PushAllExportsToGoogleSheets` command. This will send all defined exports to their Google Sheets. For instance:

```php
use Enflow\LaravelExcelToGoogleSheet\PushExportsToGoogleSheets;

$schedule->command(PushAllExportsToGoogleSheets::class)->dailyAt(3)->environments('production');
```

## Testing
``` bash
$ composer test
```
